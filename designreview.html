  	<p>As a class we all went through the same beginning steps: wireframes, sitemaps, 
  and markups. Once we reached the level of coding, however, it was up to each of us to 
  figure out how we were going to develop the HTML & CSS.</p>
  	<p>My design documents were put together from what little I have to show that relates to
   my major and a few things about myself. Not many things from high school career have 
   carried over into college, so there is little to show off. With these materials I 
   crafted 5 pages of information and spiced the pages up a little. The little spice was 
   color. One day, I will figure out how to put sparkles into my portfolio and then it 
   will be perfect! </p> 
 	<p>Other than the color, I chose pictures that were either taken when I was a senior in 
  high school since they look very nice and ones I thought pertained to the page like my 
  MSU bowling picture.</p>
  	<p>I had originally decided to do all of my html first, and then the CSS. It was very 
  tedious to have to code in Text Wrangler and commit to Github just to see if my code was
   working right. In our scrub groups, Nikita suggested that I code in Codecademy, since
    you get faster results, and copy  & paste what I needed to. This worked to some extent 
    for me, but there was some coding in there that I didn’t know what it did. Some of the 
    code that I had borrowed from Codecademy wasn’t anything I wanted, but it was hard to 
    weed out since I didn’t know what all of it meant. </p> 
 	 <p>After taking some time away from life to code I met with Professor Daniels. There 
  she took me through my code and helped me to fix problems that I had (there were many). 
  Not only did that session help me develop my portfolio, but it was a great learning 
  experience. Later, when I was coding by myself there were things I could then figure out 
  without having to ask someone, go back to Codecademy to find it, or search frantically 
  through my notes. </p>
  	<p>Today, the final day, I coded for a bit by myself. I was having some troubles so I 
  asked Professor Daniels for some more help. After that, it was pretty much smooth 
  sailing.  I was able to complete my portfolio and upload it successfully. </p> 
  	<p>The design process that we went through seemed long and intense. Nonetheless, even 
  when you’re done with that there are still many changes that can be made. Some things 
  are different when you go from a markup to coding, especially when your coding skills 
  are lacking. I had originally planned on having more pictures, links, and the navigation 
  bar was going to have a gradient. </p>
  	<p>I found it difficult to arrange pictures in CSS how I wanted them, without messing up 
  the text, so I took some out. The navigation bar wasn’t looking right as a big block on 
  the right side, so I took it out. I turned the navigation into buttons on the side. 
  Since a gradient wouldn’t look quite right on such a small area I thought about moving 
  it to the header or my background. Overall the background won out. After all, the gradient 
  is probably the coolest part to my page, so I couldn’t very well throw it out. </p> 
  	<p>I know there is little on my page, but I have only finished my freshman year of 
  college and plan to make many more things that I will add to my portfolio to highlight 
  my skills as a writer. I really want more papers and creative works to add to my portfolio. 
  I also would like some more extracurricular activities or hobbies. Aside from content 
  I plan to redesign the theme somehow. Not quite sure yet, but I’m thinking something textual.</p>
 	 <p>Even though this portfolio assignment is done, I want to keep learning code on Codecademy.
   I’ve already joined a group that gives you idea on ways to practice your HTML & CSS. 
   I also started learning some jQuery. After that I plan on learning Java & PHP. I do 
   enjoy coding, but troubleshooting gets rather tedious. Well now that this class is done 
   I will have more free time to code on Codecademy and we shall see where that takes me.</p>
