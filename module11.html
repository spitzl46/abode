  	<p style="font-family:Apple Chancery">In my scrum team with Nikita I was having trouble
  	figuring out how to link multiple pages to the main index page without my information
  	showing up on my landing page. Also I was having problems with setting my navigation on
  	the right side. Nikita was helpful and explained how he did his pages. As for my
  	navigation I will just have to mess around with my CSS.
  	</p> 
  	<p style="font-family:Apple Chancery">Nikita's design is pretty much done already. He
  	asked me to look it over. Everything looked great and functioned properly. There 
  	weren't any coding problems. The only suggestion I had was maybe some rephrasing for his
  	landing page paragraph. He said he was having problems with his search bar, but he is 
  	working on it. My only suggestion for that was talking to Professor Daniels, but he
  	had other resources as well that he was looking into.</p>
  	<p style="font-family:Apple Chancery">My goals for these workshop days was just to get
  	as much done as possible. I haven't been super successful in my progress between a trip
  	to Washington D.C. and work, but I have set a couple of days aside to focus completely
  	on my site.</p>
  	<p style="font-family:Apple Chancery">The places I have gotten help from other than
  	Nikita have been websites. Mainly <li a href="www.css3.me">www.css3.me</li> and <li
  	a href="www.w3schools.com/css">www.w3schools.com/css</li>.
