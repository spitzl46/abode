  <p font-family="Apple Chancery">In keeping my content separate from my presentation I would say that so far I have 
  done a good job. I have made a separate page for my HTML and CSS. I made a basic structure
  with the HTML and then added the CSS.</p> 
  <p font-family="Apple Chancery">As far as my markups go I have had a couple comments that they are too plain. However,
  I have only finished my freshmen year of college. I have a lot more to learn and a lot more
  to add to my portfolio. My site will grow it will fill up as I have more worthy pieces 
  to add.</p>
  <p font-family="Apple Chancery">Some things that I would do differently would be to start earlier, for starters, as well
  as have a better plan in place when I start out coding any future sites. I plan on making
  bulleted list of all key things I need to cover and in an order I feel more comfortable with.
  I will also have the knowledge and lessons I have learned from this course and my own coding
  experience to help me with my next coding experience.</p>
